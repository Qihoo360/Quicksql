# FAQ

!!! Info "What is Quicksql?"
    Quicksql is a SQL query product which can be used for specific
    datastore queries or multiple datastores correlated queries.
    It supports relational databases, non-relational databases
    and even datastore which does not support SQL (such as Elasticsearch, Druid) .
    In addition, a SQL query can join or union data from multiple
    datastores in Quicksql. For example, you can perform unified
    SQL query on one situation that a part of data stored on Elasticsearch,
    but the other part of data stored on Hive. The most important is that
    QSQL is not dependent on any intermediate compute engine, users only
    need to focus on data and unified SQL grammar to finished statistics
    and analysis.
